# evolutionaryflasks
a genetic competition based GANN
#MUTATE function that takes in RATE(mutation rate) and X(variable to mutate) if the first random is smaller than rate it returns a new random variable else X.
	#CROSSOVER function that take in RATE(Crossover rate),A parent one, B parent two and crosses over if RATE is larger than the new random number.
  #Fit function assignes a fitness value to N given X input and Y output.
  #LCheck function a len check that return the len or 0
  #ACTIVATE is a Sigmoidal squishification function
  #DOT is a Peicewise multipication of two lists
  #PWS is a Peicewise subtraction of two lists
  #Neuron is a base class of Neural Networks.
  #Network class is a generator network with M inputs, N outputs, and D depth.
  #Decriminator class is a decriminator network with M inputs, N wide hidden layers, and D depth
